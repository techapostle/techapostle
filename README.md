# 👋 Hi, I'm Kian

I’m a software developer with a passion for building secure, efficient, and developer-focused tools. My work spans systems programming, cross-platform engineering, and applied AI — often with an emphasis on privacy, modularity, and performance.

I care deeply about building things that are not just clever, but *useful* — from low-level infrastructure to polished user-facing experiences. Whether I’m optimizing algorithms, architecting full-stack pipelines, or designing privacy-preserving ML workflows, I’m always aiming to ship clean, maintainable, and meaningful code.

- 🧠 Areas of interest: system design, compiler tooling, developer infrastructure, embedded AI, and cross-platform interoperability.
- 🛡 Currently building NDA-protected developer tools and distributed systems at [Techtangelo](https://github.com/techapostle).
- 🧰 Languages & tools I work with daily: `C++`, `TypeScript`, `Python`, `React`, `PostgreSQL`, `Linux`, `Vim`, and `Zsh`.
- 🏗 Often working at the intersection of **developer experience**, **system performance**, and **privacy-first architecture**.

## 🧪 Notable Skills & Focus Areas

- **Systems Programming:** Performance-critical applications, C++ abstractions, memory optimization, and build tooling.
- **Developer Tools & DX:** Command-line interfaces, modular backends, and scripting to automate workflows.
- **Cross-Platform Engineering:** Building consistent behavior across Linux, web, and embedded platforms.
- **AI & ML Applications:** Practical use of LLMs and vision models, including local inference workflows.
- **Infrastructure:** Containerized deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud/on-prem orchestration.

## 🔐 Project Work (NDA)

I currently lead and contribute to multiple internal tools under NDA, including:

- A privacy-first AI platform.
- A distributed system for synchronized data broadcasting across devices.
- Infrastructure to support developer-focused, role-based coordination and secure deployment workflows.

All code and implementation details are confidential and protected under internal IP agreements.
